# Latitude Financial Services Engineering Practices Documentation

This document is lifted straight from Google's engineering practices with some
tweaks for things that make sense to use here at Latitude.

Currently this contains the following documents:

*   [Latitude's Code Review Guidelines](review/index.md), which are actually two
    separate sets of documents:
    *   [The Code Reviewer's Guide](review/reviewer/index.md)
    *   [The Change Author's Guide](review/developer/index.md)

## Terminology

Term Clarification:

*   **CL**: Stands for "changelist", which means one self-contained change that
    has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.
    Other organizations often call this a "change", "patch", or "pull-request".
*   **LGTM**: Means "Looks Good to Me". It is what a code reviewer says when
    approving a CL.
*   **NIT**: Means "nitpick" which is where a reviewer is making a comment on a CL
    but it is only meant as a mild suggestion rather than a request for change.
